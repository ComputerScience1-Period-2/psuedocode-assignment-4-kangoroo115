Get a standard deck of 52 cards and a table;
Determine number of players;
WHILE (cards are not spread evenly to each player)
  DO keep spreading cards to each player evenly;
  
  
  
  
  You do not need an ENDWHILE. the whole point of a while loop is to have it end when a condition is met.
  so: while(cardsnotshuffeld=true){
  shuffle the cards;
  if(cardsareshuffled)
  {
  cardsnotshuffled=false;
  }
  }
  
  
ENDWHILE;
Card information are kept hidden from other players;
Determine which player initiates start of round and which way players take turns;
Player that initiates round starts by placing card face up in the middle of table without looking at card information;
WHILE (start player plays card)
  DO each player takes their turn playing their card until an identical number is revealed, regardless of color and group;
ENDWHILE;
IF (card with identical number is placed together)
  THEN the first player to slap the pile of cards with their hand will take every card adding it to their deck;
  ELSE continue with game;
ENDIF;
IF (player obtains all 52 cards)
  THEN player that obtains all cards wins the round;
  ELSE continue with game;
ENDIF;
